        He was born in Al-Qassim Region, Saudi Arabia on either 20 July or 5 September 1974.[1]

In September 2014, he established contact with IS and sought pledges of allegiance on their behalf. In late 2014, he allegedly facilitated the movement of people and material for IS operations in Saudi Arabia. According to the Treasury, he "was in Yemen with a group that pledged allegiance to ISIL and received significant funding from either ISIL or an unidentified donor".

According to the United States Department of the Treasury, he recruited for the Islamic State in Yemen in mid-2015 having received funding from IS in 2014 to implement their plan in Yemen. He declined to recruit and facilitate efforts in Yemen on behalf of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in favor of an alleged promise of 4,000 al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb fighters by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
